            <p class="poppins-regular">I have always been passionate about art and creativity, and I love using my talents to bring joy to others. 
            I found resin art during a difficult period of my life, and it quickly became not only one of my favorite mediums but also a form of therapy for me.
            I hope you enjoy my work as much as I enjoy creating it!</p>
